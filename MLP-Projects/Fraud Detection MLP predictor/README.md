# 💳 Fraud Detection MLP Predictor (Deep Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview

This project builds a **Fraud Detection System** using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** implemented in **PyTorch**.

The model predicts whether a financial transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** based on transaction details such as amount, device, location, and user behavior.

## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end Deep Learning pipeline
- Data preprocessing using `ColumnTransformer`
- Handling missing values (numerical + categorical)
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- MLP model built using PyTorch
- Batch training using DataLoader
- Streamlit web application for real-time predictions
- Model + Preprocessor saving for deployment

## 🧠 Model Architecture


Input Layer → 128 → ReLU → 64 → ReLU → Output → Sigmoid


- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy (`BCELoss`)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Epochs: 1200+
- Learning Rate: 0.0005

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **51,000 transactions** with features:

- Transaction_Amount
- Transaction_Type
- Time_of_Transaction
- Device_Used
- Location
- Previous_Fraudulent_Transactions
- Account_Age
- Number_of_Transactions_Last_24H
- Payment_Method

Target:
- `Fraudulent` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

## 🧪 Training

Run the training script:

```bash
python src/train.py

This will:

Train the MLP model
Save the trained model to model/model.pth
Save the preprocessing pipeline to model/preprocessor.pkl
🌐 Run the App
streamlit run app.py
